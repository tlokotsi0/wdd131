        <h2>History of Semonkong</h2>
        <p>
            Semonkong, meaning "Place of Smoke", is a historic village nestled in the heart of Lesotho. Here's a glimpse into its past:

            Origins: Semonkong was established in the 1880s as a refuge for Basotho people displaced during the Basuto Gun War. 
            This conflict saw the Basotho people resisting the Cape Colony's attempts to disarm them.
            The village provided a sanctuary for those fleeing the war, contributing to its growth and development.
            <br><br>Semonkong is renowned for its proximity to the majestic Maletsunyane Falls, one of the highest single-drop waterfalls in the world. The falls create a misty "smoke" that gives the village its name.
            Historically, Semonkong's remote location contributed to its unique character. It served as a hideout for outlaws and retained an untamed atmosphere.
            Today, Semonkong is a popular destination for tourists seeking adventure and natural beauty. It offers activities like pony trekking, hiking, and exploring the stunning Maletsunyane Falls. The village also provides a glimpse into the rich cultural heritage of the Basotho people.
